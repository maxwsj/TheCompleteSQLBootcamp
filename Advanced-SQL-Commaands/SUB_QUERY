-- Let's return the films that have a rental rate that is higher than the average rental rate for all the films similar to the test score:
SELECT title, rental_rate

-- IF our subquery returns multiple values, we need to use IN
SELECT film_id, title
FROM film

INNER JOIN inventory ON inventory.inventory_id = rental.inventory_id
WHERE return_date BETWEEN '2005-05-29' AND '2005-05-30')

SELECT first_name, last_name
