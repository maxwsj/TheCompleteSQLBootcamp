-- We could do like this:
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) 
FROM payment
WHERE customer_id NOT IN (184,87,477) -- List of Values
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- But we cannot filter into the SUM(amount), because it happen only when the GROUP BY starts
-- That's where we use the HAVING:
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) 
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(amount) > 200;

-- If we wanted to know the number of customers per store
SELECT store_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM customer
GROUP BY store_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 200;
